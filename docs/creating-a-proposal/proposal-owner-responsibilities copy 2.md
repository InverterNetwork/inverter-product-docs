# Proposal Owner Responsibilities

The Proposal Owner is the agent responsible for initiating and maintaining Proposals. Let's cover what that means exactly.

From a high-level perspective, Proposal owners are responsible for:

-   Communication with funders, and making sure they consent to continue funding.
    

-   Accountability and making sure funds are used responsibly
    

-   Tracking the work progress
    

-   Managing the required transactions during a proposal's life cycle
    

Proposal owners need to be actively maintaining the proposal during the whole Proposal lifecycle to successfully accomplish the high-level tasks stated above.

**The Proposal Owner will be responsible for:**

-   Answering curated questions to be able to apply for grant programs inside the dApp.
    

-   Triggering the initial funding stream after the proposal pool has attained its specified minimum funding amount (which corresponds to the requested budget for Milestone 1).
    

-   Defining and adding milestones from the proposal's initiation and continuously as it grows and evolves or to meets certain funding requirements*****.
    

-  Uploading Proof of Deliverable Completion documents to be able to kick-start streaming of the next milestone's funds.*
    

-  Triggering the funding stream for the next milestone after a milestone is completed and reported.
    

-  Editing milestones or deliverables to incorporate new changes, perhaps as a result of the feedback provided by the funders or if the roadmap changes**.
    

*The Proposal owner may add a new milestone specific such as "Deploy on Celo Chain" since Celo requires your project team to deploy in the Celo chain to provide the grant.

**If a problem occurs during project development and causes a delay in the completion of milestones, the Proposal Owner would edit future milestones to ensure the roadmap stays synchronized with the development process.
