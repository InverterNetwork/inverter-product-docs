  # Proposal Quality Assurance Guideline

In order to ensure the quality of projects on our DApp, we have implemented a process for pre-screening projects before they are displayed on the Inverter All Proposals page. Until they are reviewed and approved by an Inverter Verification Team, all new projects are, in the beginning, **unverified**. Unlisted projects can still receive funding and can be accessed via the proposal URL. However, only **verified** projects will appear on the Inverter homepage and all proposals page.

If a project does not meet the listed criteria below, the project owner will receive an email asking them to update the project. If the project owner updates their project, it will be reviewed again by our team.

If a project is reviewed and found to violate our **Terms of Use**, it will be **canceled** immediately, and the project owner will be notified via email.

The following guide is for helping Proposal Owners in creating high-quality proposals and supporting the Verification Team in the review process.

**Verified Proposals**

In order for a project to be verified and listed on the dApp, it must have the following:

-   Clear proposal inputs, including;
    
    -   Who they are
        
    
    -   Clear specification of milestones and deliverables
        
    
    -   What funders can expect as an outcome of your work
        
    
    -   Detailed explanation of the project
        
    

-   No violations of our **Terms of Use**

To ensure smooth onboarding of Inverter users, especially for web2 organizations, we created a squad of Progam Managers that helps organizations to create the best possible proposal for accessing funding.
