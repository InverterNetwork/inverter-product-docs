In Inverter, projects are required to define their roadmaps by specifying milestones and deliverables. In Inverter, milestone reporting is vital to communicate with the funders that the development of the project is continuing as promised. This is the main way to maintain the consent of funders and continue to receive optimistic funding approval, as in Inverter funds will stream towards the project team as long as the Proposal owner provides Proof of Deliverable Completion reports and funders do not withdraw funds due to their dissatisfaction with the reports.

In the proposal creation process, Proposal Owners will be asked to write a list of deliverables aimed to be completed in the milestone, the required budget, and the duration for completing the work for each milestone.

Deliverables: refers to a smaller chunk of accomplishment to complete a milestone (ex; Milestone: Finishing the UI/UX of the Product -- Deliverable 1: Create low fidelity wireframes in Miro.) Proposal Owners need to upload documents for the completion of each deliverable under a milestone.

Required Budget: refers to funding that the project team needs to achieve the completion of the milestone. This budget will drip in the timespan of Estimated duration.

Estimated duration: refers to the approximate time of the completion of a milestone. The Milestone budget will be streamed in that period.

After defining milestones, Proposal Owners are expected to manage milestones (edit or add milestones if needed) and report milestone completion. Reporting and editing Milestone based on the funders' feedback is the way to communicate and ensure the consent of the funders. (to learn more about proposal owner responsibilities, refer:

Proposal Owner Responsibilities.)

Reporting Milestones

In Inverter, to start the stream of funding for each milestone, Proposal Owners need to upload Proof of Deliverable Completion document for deliverables under a specific milestone. These uploaded documents will be publicly displayed to communicate the project team's development process. Also, those reports will be open for feedback by the funders (to learn more: [Becoming a Funder](https://app.gitbook.com/o/I2pW8EuBbOZ5F0ovZEvq/s/2Gxrjq5q8qOAwA1G6I3o/funding-a-proposal/becoming-a-funder)) so that the contributing team can always maintain alignment between the progress of their work and the funders' consent. Based on the feedback, project teams could re-upload their reports. Also, if proposal funders are not satisfied with Proposal Owners' Proof of Deliverable Completion documents, they can withdraw their funding at any time.

The trigger of the stream of a new milestone after completing one by uploading Proof of Deliverable Completion reports will look like this:

-   Imagine your proposal has a second milestone titled "Finishing up high fidelity UX mockups" with two deliverables, two months duration, and a 10,000 USDC budget.
    

-   Over 2 months, 10,000 USDC will be streamed to the project's treasury address.
    

-   After finishing Milestone 2, as a Proposal Owner, you upload a Proof of Deliverable Completion document for all the deliverables under the milestone and trigger the transaction.
    

-   When you have uploaded two Proof of Deliverabel Completion documents and the 2-month duration for Milestone 2 has passed, **then** Milestone 3 will be available to initiate.
    

-   You make a transaction to initiate funding for Milestone 3.
    

This process is not required for Milestone 1. Milestone 1 is **guaranteed payment** for Proposals. In other words, no matter what happens funding amount worth milestone 1 can not be withdrawn by funders. Since there is no reporting process to kickstart milestone 1, for milestone 1 to start the stream, first, the proposal pool needs to have enough funds to cover its budget, and second, Proposal Owner must trigger the stream.

## Editing Milestone[](https://app.gitbook.com/#editing-milestone)

Proposal Owners can edit their proposal details, including milestones. However, Proposal Owners can only add and edit future milestones, not an already active one.

The editing function is mostly needed in;

-   Editing future milestones in the case of roadmap changes
    
    -   For example, if a problem occurs in the project development, which will cause a delay in the completion of milestones, Proposal Owner would edit future milestones to ensure the roadmap compatibility with the development process.
        
    
    -   For example, Proposal Owner may add a new milestone specific such as "Deploy in Celo Chain" because Celo requires your project team to deploy in the Celo chain to provide the grant.)
        
    

-   Correcting a mistake at the creation of the Proposal
    

-   Incorporating feedback from the funders
    

-   Re-scoping of the budget and changes in the team
