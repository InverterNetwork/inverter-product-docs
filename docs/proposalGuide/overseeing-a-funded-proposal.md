title: Overseeing a Funded Proposal 
---
Funders are expected to oversee the funded proposals by providing **feedback** on Proof of Deliverable Completion reports and **withdrawing funds** in the case of unsatisfactory development. Funders will receive notifications when a Proposal Owner upload proof of Deliverable completion document and change or add milestones for helping them in their overseeing tasks.

## **Feedback on Proof of Deliverable Completion reports**[](https://app.gitbook.com/#feedback-on-proof-of-deliverable-completion-reports)

One of the other important processes in overseeing funded proposals is providing feedback to the Proof of Deliverable Completion reports. Inverter allows funders to be able to comment their feedback on specific Milestones. This feedback could be provided for **suggestions for the proposal team regarding the next reporting phase** or the funders**' reasoning for the withdrawal of funds and their dissatisfaction point about the Deliverable reports**. Proposal Owners **can re-upload their milestone reports in reflection of this feedback. But, the previous versions of the upload will be visible to funders.**

Having a feedback mechanism allows feedback loops between funders and Proposal Owners to ensure smoother development of the project. Also, as a funder being able to see feedback from different organization increase the transparency of information.

## **Withdrawal of Funds**[](https://app.gitbook.com/#withdrawal-of-funds)

While overseeing milestone reports, withdrawing funds when needed is a very important responsibility for funders since **hard**  **accountability is ensured by funders' ability to withdraw funding any time when they are not satisfied with the Proof of Milestone Completion document** that is uploaded by Proposal Owner after the duration of each milestone. If the funders do not check Proof of Deliverable completion reports and do not withdraw their funds in the case of unsatisfactory reports, their funding will continue to drip toward the project team; thus wasted. This is because uploading Deliverable reports (regardless of their quality) triggers the streaming of upcoming milestone resources (to see more details about the milestone process, refer: [Milestones](./managing-milestones.md).)
