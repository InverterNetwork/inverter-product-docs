# Introduction to inProposals

In Inverter, an invProposal serves two purposes:

- Communication and transparency with funders and the public
    
- To deploy a unique smart contract for the proposal to interact with existing protocols and mecnphanisms in the Ethereum ecosystem.
    
## Proposals for Communication and Transparency

inProposals contain core project information and answers to a set of standardized questions, allowing potential funders to get a clear overview of what is going to be built. In addition, grant programs can provide their own questions in order for proposals to apply for a given grant program. More information about the content of the proposals can be found in How to create a Proposal ?.

Once funding distribution is initiated, a proposal also becomes the platform for **tracking work accomplished and the communication channel for maintaining the consent of the funders.** This is done through reporting and managing milestones.

By **a single proposal that multiple funders are connected with (inProposal),** the Proposal Owner can update all their funders with the progress of the work by uploading Proof of Deliverable Completion documents and have access to the feedback that the funders give on the work being done which Proposal Owners will utilize to reconcile their work and maintain consent.

## Proposals as Smart Contract Address

In Inverter, each published proposal produces a smart contract address that can be used to interact with other funding mediums such as Snapshot, Gardens, and more. That way, funders can have benefits of the Inverter without changing their preferred way of decision-making in funding proposals. To see how a proposal's contract address can be used on other platforms, see: Use Cases
