# Core Benefits of Inverter

_Inverter Network aims to make long-term collaborative initiatives such as joint ventures, open source work, or research much simpler to get_ **_co-funded by reducing the administrative burden and_**_;_ **_increasing accountability_** _and_ **_transparency_** _for both funders and contributor teams._

## Joint Funding with Reduced Administrative Overhead[](https://app.gitbook.com/#joint-funding-with-reduced-administrative-overhead)

Inverter allows anyone to make a proposal open for co-funding and collaboration from an infinite number of entities. We provide an easy-to-use platform for the owners of these proposals to manage and record the receipt and disbursal of collected funds from various organizations to a group of contributors. With the Inverter, contributors don’t have to track payment schemes from different entities; Inverter collects all the funds received and creates a unique stream of funds to every contributor working on the project according to the customizable settings of the proposal.

Our platform helps projects to save time and headaches of creating multiple proposals for multiple organizations. With Inverter, **project teams will have one proposal that can be used for many organizations.** This method allows a clear reference point for discussions, and participants can easily keep track of information. Moreover, one common proposal can be used for applying to multiple grant programs. That way, projects can tap into grant funding without the headaches of navigating a myriad of governance processes.

Proposal Owners can keep their funders up to date and access funding without needing to repetitively engage with each funders' internal governance processes to unlock funding for the next milestone. **By uploading Proof of Deliverable completion documents, Proposal owners communicate the development with all the funders at once and are able to unlock funding for their next milestone**. The platform also provides assurances to funders via Milestone funding with allows funders to withdraw funds under certain conditions - Read more below in [**Accountibility**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/I2pW8EuBbOZ5F0ovZEvq/s/2Gxrjq5q8qOAwA1G6I3o/inverter-overview/core-benefits-of-inverter#accountability)**.**

## Accountability[](https://app.gitbook.com/#accountability)

The proposal owner can define success for them at each checkpoint on their journey, these effectively become milestones. Inverter creates accountability to funders using a system of these defined milestones, which allows funding to unlock progressively with the successful completion of each milestone. The Inverter adopts an optimistic approval process for the completion of the milestones where work is considered satisfactory until a funder objects and decides to withdraw the funds. If a project isn't capable of producing a satisfactory Proof of Deliverable Completion report, funders can withdraw their funds (except their funding amount towards milestone 1, which is treated as a guaranteed payment for the project). That way, **funders are guaranteed to have their resources spent only if they are satisfied with the progress of the project's ongoing work based on their committed deliverables and budget planning**.

The clear advantage for contributors working on exploratory or open-ended projects on longer timelines is that project teams do not need to repeat bureaucratic proposal processes for different organizations, while still held to an accountable process for reporting their progress to their funders.

## Transparency[](https://app.gitbook.com/#transparency)

Through a detailed Proposal Dashboard, Inverter provides anyone, including funders, to quick and clear access to a wide variety of key information, including:

-   Who is already funding this proposal
    

-   Who is contributing to this proposal
    

-   Public discussions about the proposal in community forums
    

-   The proposal's target funding goal
    

-   Established Milestones and Deliverables
    

-   Proof of Deliverable Completion reports
    

By becoming aware of the talent pool that the project has, funders will be more confident about the team’s ability to complete the project. Creating transparency around the flow of funds into and inside the proposal allows funders to evaluate their capital management and funders also benefit from seeing who has already contributed funding to make strategic decisions.

In general, being able to easily assess this important information from one place helps funders to make better-informed decisions.
